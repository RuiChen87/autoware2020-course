# Self-Driving Cars with ROS and Autoware

hosted by Apex.AI
​
- Self-driving cars will transform the way we travel and commute.
This technology merges robotics, machine learning, engineering,
and modern software development methods.


### What is the course about?

Developing production-grade autonomous driving systems require a stack of interrelated technologies. This course brings together all the significant parts into a practical step-by-step guide to architect, develop, test, and deploy an autonomous system.

This **intermediate-level** course using the popular open-source robotics frameworks ROS 2 and **Autoware.Auto** algorithms and covers through the course of 14 lectures,  state-of-the-art techniques that combine hardware, software, algorithms, methodologies, tools, and data analytics.

### What will I learn?

You’ll learn a modern approach to developing complex systems for autonomy that the most innovative automotive companies are adopting. The teachers are experienced professionals who have contributed open-source materials moving the industry towards higher standards of design, engineering, and safety. 

### Who should take the course?

This is an intermediate-level course for individuals who develop pre-production autonomous driving systems. ​Participants should have knowledge of C++ (including testing), robotics frameworks, and system integration.
